title: "Emulator of retro x86-based machines"
---

**86Box** is an IBM PC system emulator that specializes in running old operating systems and software designed for IBM PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent system designs based on the PCI bus.

The project maintainer is OBattler.

Licensing
---------
86Box is released under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

Features
--------
* Easy to use interface
* Cycle-accurate low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium
* Great range of customizability of virtual machines
* Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture
* Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters
* MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland synthesizers
* Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications for these systems

Downloads
---------
The latest stable version of 86Box is version 3.0, which was released on December 1, 2021, and is available from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/tag/v3.0).

We also offer [nightly builds](https://github.com/86Box/86Box#automatic-builds), which are built from the latest source code, but may not be as stable and/or optimized as stable builds.

System requirements and recommendations
---------------------------------------
* Intel Core 2 or AMD Athlon 64 processor
* Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10
* 4 GB of RAM

It is also recommended to use the [86Box Manager](https://github.com/86Box/86BoxManager) by [daviunic](https://github.com/daviunic) (Overdoze) to manage virtual machines even though it is possible to use 86Box on its own with the `--vmpath`/`-P` command line option.
