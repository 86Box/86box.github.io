title: "Emulator of retro x86-based machines"
---

**86Box** is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software designed for IBM PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent system designs based on the PCI bus.

Features
--------
* Easy to use interface inspired by mainstream hypervisor software
* Low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium with focus on accuracy
* Great range of customizability of virtual machines
* Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture
* Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters
* MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland synthesizers
* Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications for these systems

<a name="downloads" />Downloads
-------------------------------
The latest stable version of 86Box is **v3.3**, which was released on March 18, 2022, and is available from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/tag/v3.3).

We also offer [nightly builds](https://ci.86box.net/job/86Box), which are built from the latest source code, but may not be as stable and/or optimized as stable builds.

Minimum system requirements and recommendations
-----------------------------------------------
* Intel Core 2 or AMD Athlon 64 processor
* Windows version: Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10
* Linux version: Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 9.0 or other distributions from 2016 onwards
* macOS version (currently nightly builds only): macOS 10.13 High Sierra
* 4 GB of RAM

Performance may vary depending on both host and guest configuration. Most emulation logic is executed in a single thread; therefore, systems with better IPC (instructions per clock) generally should be able to emulate higher clock speeds.

It is also recommended to use a manager application (**Windows only**) with 86Box for easier handling of multiple virtual machines.
* [WinBox for 86Box](https://github.com/86Box/WinBox-for-86Box) by Laci b√°'
  * The new manager with improved new user experience; installer, automatic updates of emulator files and more.
  * While development is suspended and the repository is archived, the latest version is fully functional.
* [86Box Manager](https://github.com/86Box/86BoxManager) by [daviunic](https://github.com/daviunic) (Overdoze)
  * The traditional 86Box manager with a simple interface.

It is also possible to use 86Box on its own with the `--vmpath`/`-P` command line option.
