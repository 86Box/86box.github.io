**86Box** is a hypervisor and IBM PC system emulator that specializes in
running old operating systems and software designed for IBM PC systems and
compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent system designs based on the
PCI bus.

Features
--------
* Easy to use interface
* Cycle-accurate low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium
* Great range of customizability of virtual machines
* Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the
  more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture
* Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network
  adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters
* MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland
  synthesizers
* Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux
  distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications
  for these systems

Downloads
---------
The latest _stable_ version of 86Box is v1.07, which was released on 21 February
2017 and is terribly _outdated_. It is instead recommended to use the latest [nightly builds](https://github.com/86Box/86Box#nightly-builds) available from 
our Jenkins instance, which include all features listed above.
