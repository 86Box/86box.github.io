This is the October 2023 update to 86Box, bringing bugfixes over [the original v4.0 release](/2023/08/26/86box-v4-0.html), as well as a few new features.

The work-in-progress build currently available to our [**Patreon supporters**](https://www.patreon.com/86box) will be receiving a v4.0.1 update as well. This WIP build contains a new **Local Switch** feature for connecting 86Box machines locally or across a network in a plug-and-play, cross-platform way, without relying on PCap or VDE.

## Important notes

### ROM set update

Despite this being a minor bugfix release, the **ROM set was also updated** to reorganize the growing collection of **Plug and Play Sound Blaster** cards and fix an issue with the **MSI MS-5119** machine. Remember to update the ROM set when updating 86Box, otherwise emulated machines using any of the aforementioned hardware **will have it removed**.

### MSI MS-5119 BIOS update

After updating the ROM set, the MS-5119 BIOS update to fix PS/2 mouse issues is **not applied automatically to existing emulated machines** using that board. Apply it by deleting `ms5119.bin` from the machine's `nvr` directory, then start the machine and check if the BIOS version displayed below the American Megatrends logo is `A37EB` instead of the previous `A37E`.

### Tertiary and quaternary IDE

Due to a longstanding oversight, previous versions of 86Box had the tertiary and quaternary IDE controllers **switch places**, using the incorrect I/O port and IRQ resources for their respective channels. This swap has now been fixed; additionally, the tertiary channel provided by **Plug and Play Sound Blaster cards** is now a quaternary channel. If you use these additional IDE channels, make sure any drives connected to them are placed correctly after updating.
