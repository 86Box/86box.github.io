This is the March 2024 update to 86Box, bringing bugfixes over [the original v4.1 release]({% post_url 2024-02-21-86box-v4-1 %}) and some new hardware.

As always, the work-in-progress build currently available to our [**Patreon supporters**](https://www.patreon.com/86box) will be updated accordingly.

## Important notes

### ROM set update

A minor change was made to the ROM set. Users of the base **Sound Blaster AWE64** (not the Value or Gold) should update the ROM set, as an accurate CT4380 Plug and Play ROM was located. If this update is not present, the card will **disappear from emulated machines** and the sound card selector until the ROM set is updated.

The newly-added machines also require an updated ROM set, otherwise they will not be listed in the machine selector.
