This is the September 2025 update to 86Box, bringing in some new features and the results of a bugfix marathon started right after [the v5.0 release]({% post_url 2025-08-24-86box-v5-0 %}).

## Important changes

### Host system deprecations

As noted in the [v5.0 release announcement]({% post_url 2025-08-24-86box-v5-0 %}#host-system-deprecations), support for macOS hosts running **High Sierra 10.13** and **Mojave 10.14** is scheduled to be removed. However, due to the short amount of time since the previous release, 86Box v5.1 **still supports** these macOS versions, and the removal will take place in a future update.

### Merged machines

In previous versions of 86Box, several machines had **separate entries** in the machine list for different BIOS vendors or OEM customizations. These variants have now been **merged** into their respective base entries, using the new BIOS variant selection system introduced in v5.0, accessed through the **Configure** button next to the machine selector.

If your emulated setup uses one of those machine variants, upgrading to 86Box v5.1 will **automatically migrate** the configuration and CMOS data to this new system. After this migration, downgrading to v5.0 or older is not recommended. If the machine no longer boots after upgrading, make sure the **ROM set** is up to date.
