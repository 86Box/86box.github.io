This is the October 2025 update to 86Box, bringing in a few more new features, lots of new machines and the obligatory bugfixes.

---

## Main features

### Floppy drive sounds

We often get requests to add **ambient sounds**, to make emulated setups sound just like real hardware for a more immersive experience. [Domppari](https://github.com/Domppari) took the first step towards that by contributing **floppy sounds** recorded from actual drives, leveraging our accurate floppy emulation to track the drive's motor and head activity.

These sounds are not enabled by default; they can be enabled through the [**floppy drive settings**](https://86box.readthedocs.io/en/v5.2/settings/floppycdrom.html#floppy-drives) by selecting a drive model in the **Audio** box. Recordings from **one 3.5"** and **two 5.25"** drive models are currently available as part of the ROM set.

### Other highlights

Many new **game port joystick types** have been added, between generic options and real models from CH Products and Thrustmaster, expanding upon the previous joystick work led by [jriwanek](https://github.com/jriwanek) in v5.0.

The Settings window's **machine list** is quite overwhelming due to the sheer amount of categories and machine models available. Locating a specific model - when following a guide, for instance - can be tricky, so a **search box** has been added to help quickly locate any machine by its name or chipset.

## Important changes

### Machine changes

The **IBM PCjr** no longer has a floppy drive controller by default. PCjr setups with a floppy drive must now have the [FD controller](https://86box.readthedocs.io/en/v5.2/settings/storage.html#fd-controller) set to **Internal device** for the drive to work.

Continuing the work [started in v5.1]({% post_url 2025-09-14-86box-v5-1 %}#merged-machines), **3 OEM machines** (listed in the 686 category [below](#machines)) have moved and are now BIOS variant options for their respective base motherboards. As before, configuration and CMOS data is **migrated automatically** upon upgrading to v5.2, and if the machine no longer boots, make sure the **ROM set** is up to date.

On top of that, 5 other machines (listed in the 586 and 686 categories [below](#machines)) have received BIOS updates; however, existing emulated setups will remain on the previous BIOS until an NVRAM wipe is performed, either [through the manager's right-click menu](https://86box.readthedocs.io/en/v5.2/usage/manager.html#machine-list) or by deleting the respective `.bin` file in the machine's `nvr` directory.

### Host system deprecations

**32-bit x86 and ARM32** host systems are no longer fully supported when compiling 86Box from source. Support for these 32-bit architectures has been [deprecated for over a year]({% post_url 2024-07-26-86box-v4-2 %}#32-bit-deprecation-notice), with builds no longer provided [since v5.0]({% post_url 2025-08-24-86box-v5-0 %}#host-system-deprecations); it has now been removed from the source code to allow us to better focus on the relevant x64 and ARM64 architectures.

macOS **High Sierra 10.13** and **Mojave 10.14** support is still on track to be removed in a future update.
