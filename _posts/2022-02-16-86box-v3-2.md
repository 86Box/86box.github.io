This is the February 2022 update to 86Box, and it's one we know many of you have been looking forward to, as it finally brings in **Linux support**, after many requests over the course of many years. As always, you can [download 86Box v3.2 from GitHub](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/tag/v3.2.1).

## Now with Linux

This Linux version was made possible by the massive work put in by contributors like [**jgilje**](https://github.com/jgilje), [**Cacodemon345**](https://github.com/Cacodemon345), [**ts-korhonen**](https://github.com/ts-korhonen) and [**dob205**](https://github.com/dob205), who developed the cross-platform Qt user interface or otherwise helped with freeing our code from the shackles of Win32. This new interface should look and feel **almost exactly** like the old Windows one. A **macOS version** is also in the works, also powered by the new interface and supporting both Intel and Apple Silicon, though it wasn't ready in time for this release.

Linux builds are distributed as [**AppImage**](https://appimage.org) binaries for maximum compatibility. We've tested these on distributions as old as **Ubuntu 16.04** and as new as **Manjaro 21.2.2**, but if you run into issues on your specific distro, [please let us know](/#social). Binaries for **x86_64**, **ARM32** and **ARM64** architectures are available; 32-bit x86 is currently not available due to a [packaging issue](https://github.com/AppImageCrafters/AppRun/issues/37). Of course, building 86Box from source and running it with system libraries is still an option, and there's a [community-maintained Arch Linux AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/86box) which does just that.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** On Linux, you should place the `roms/` directory (containing the ROM set) in the **same directory** as the `.AppImage` file ([example](/assets/images/v3.2/roms.png)\). A global ROM path and a manager interface will be added in a future release. For now, you can manage emulated machines through one of the following methods:

* Keeping multiple copies (or symlinks) of the 86Box `.AppImage` and the `roms/` directory.
* Running the 86Box `.AppImage` with the `-P /path/to/machine/directory` switch, which **does not require** copying `roms/` over to the emulated machine's directory.
* Running the 86Box `.AppImage` from a different working directory, which also **does not require** copying `roms/` over.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE #2:** Still on Linux, **86Box v3.2.1** (link above, [changelog below](#v3-2-1)\) should fix the issue with mouse capture dropping the emulation speed down to 0%.

The **Windows version** will remain on the existing Win32 user interface for now, as [**jriwanek**](https://github.com/jriwanek) has stepped up to maintain it, at least while we work on some Windows-specific odds and ends of the Qt interface. All UI points in the changelog below apply to both interfaces.
