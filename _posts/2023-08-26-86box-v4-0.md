This is the August 2023 update to 86Box, bringing many improvements, bugfixes (especially for non-Windows users) and some new hardware.

It's certainly been a while since [our last update](/2022/11/26/86box-v3-11.html). Needless to say, despite the bumpy ride to this release, **we're still alive** and working on making 86Box great. We have some **exciting new features** currently being worked on for future updates, and from now on, we'll be sharing work-in-progress builds of new features with our [**Patreon supporters**](https://www.patreon.com/86box), with no impact to our regular release schedule; the first WIP build is already available to supporters, so go check it out.

## Main features

### Input

There have been many fixes to **keyboard and mouse input**. Mouse emulation was overhauled to **massively improve responsiveness**. The AT and PS/2 keyboard controller emulation was also reworked to hopefully eliminate the longstanding issue of keyboard and mouse **input suddenly stopping**, as well as other issues with PS/2 keyboards and mice on some machines.

Keyboard input on Linux and macOS hosts is now significantly improved, fixing issues with missing or mismatched keys particularly on **international keyboards**, as well as key holding. Absolute mouse input on X11 Linux hosts, which is used when running 86Box through a **virtual machine or VNC**, was also fixed.

### ATI Mach8/32

The [**Mach8 and Mach32**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_Mach_series) were clones of the **IBM 8514/A** video accelerator which helped ATI gain market momentum in the early 1990s. 86Box now provides the first ever **functional emulation** of these cards. The Mach32 in particular was a popular card, available in [five different bus variants](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/children-of-the-bus-wars/ "OS/2 Museum: Children of the Bus Wars") (of which we currently emulate ISA, MCA, VLB and PCI) as well as integrated to many motherboards, and had wide operating system support.

### Network

[**VDE**](https://github.com/virtualsquare/vde-2) virtual networking is now supported for connecting 86Box machines and even other emulators to each other on Linux and macOS hosts. While Windows is notably not supported by VDE, we're working on a solution, so stay tuned. The [86Box documentation](https://86box.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0/hardware/network.html#vde) has a full setup guide for creating a VDE network.

A nasty emulator crash when **PCap** fails to initialize was fixed, and the **SLiRP** library was updated to its full version on Windows and macOS hosts for potential performance improvements.

### Known issues

* Some applications which heavily depend on specific **8088 CPU behavior** may not work properly
* The **Ensoniq AudioPCI** no longer works with the 2001 Creative WDM driver (`SBPCI_WebDrvsV5_12_01.exe`); this driver is designed for ES1373/CT5880 cards only, has identical BSOD issues on a real ES1371, and only works in VMware and previous versions of 86Box due to emulation inaccuracies
* **Serial port passthrough** is not complete and may require reconfiguration in a future version
* **Serial port passthrough** may randomly stall the emulated machine if the other end is not connected
* The **ATI Mach8** and **Mach32** may not render some very specific video modes correctly
