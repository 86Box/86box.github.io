This is the March 2022 update to 86Box, bringing overall bugfixes and some new hardware. As always, you can [download 86Box v3.3 from GitHub](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/tag/v3.3).

This release also brings a **major change to the Windows version**: it now uses the same Qt user interface as the Linux and (future - don't worry, we're still working on it) macOS versions. As previously stated on the [v3.2 post](/2022/02/16/86box-v3-2.html#now-with-linux), this new interface should look and feel just like the old Windows one, though there are some minor changes.
